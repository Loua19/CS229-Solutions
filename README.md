My solutions for CS229 problem sets (Autumn 2018). Originally cloned from https://github.com/maxim5/cs229-2018-autumn.

To run the code:
- Install Anaconda
- Run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
- Run `conda activate cs229`

NOTE: I do not make use of the 'run.py' scripts. Instead I have manually added a `if __name__ == "__main__":` function to generate the outputs directly.
